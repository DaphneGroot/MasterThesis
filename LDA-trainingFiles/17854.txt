 NEDSCHROEF CONSIDERS SALE OF U.S. UNIT. 
 HELMOND, Nov 14 (Reuter) - Koninklijke Nedschroef Holding NV said on Wednesday it was considering the sale of its wholly-owned U.S. unit Nedschroef Corp. because it did not form part of Nedschroef's core business activities. 
 Nedschroef makes machines, tools and fastening systems such as nuts and bolts. 
 The Dutch company has been following a strategy of tailoring the products of its fastening systems business more to the needs of the car industry and its suppliers. 
 It said Nedschroef Corp, though profitable, was geared more to production for the petrochemical and construction industries. 
 Nedschroef said it had appointed Pinnacle Capital Corporation of New York to advise it on the planned sale of the Houston, Texas, based unit.
