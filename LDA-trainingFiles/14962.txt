Tekst.
Abqariyyalmajd Azmen Wa Samaha Wata ha.
Ya Rihab Al-majd Udna Min Jadid
Ummatun Nabni Bi Azmin La Yalim
Engelse vertaling.
A home land that extended its wings over the horizon,
And wore the glory of civilization as a garment -
Blessed be the land of the two rivers,
A homeland of glorious determination and tolerance.
This homeland is made of flame and splendour
And pride unequalled by the high heavens.
It is a mountain that rises above the tops of the world
And a plain that embodies our pride.
Babylon is inherent in us and Assyria is ours,
And because of the glory of our background
And it is we alone who possess the anger of the sword
And the patience of the prophets.
Oh company of al-Ba'th, you pride of lions,
Oh pinnacle of pride and of inherited glory,
Advance, bringing terror, to a certain victory
And resurrect the time of al-Rashid in our land!
We are a generation who give all and toil to the utmost.
Oh expanse of glory, we have returned anew
To a nation that we build with unyielding determination.
And each martyr follows in the footsteps of a former martyr.
Our mighty nation is filled with pride and vigour
And the comrades build the fortresses of glory.
Oh Iraq, may you remain forever a refuge for all the Arabs
And be as suns that turn night into day!
